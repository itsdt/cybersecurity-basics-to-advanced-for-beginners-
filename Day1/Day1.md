# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Today, we’ll cover the basics of cybersecurity, its importance, and key concepts. Let’s dive in.

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information or disrupt business operations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
2. **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and resources when needed.

### Importance of Cybersecurity

- **Protects Sensitive Data**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal and financial information.
- **Ensures Business Continuity**: Minimizes downtime and maintains productivity.
- **Prevents Financial Loss**: Reduces the risk of theft and fraud.
- **Builds Trust**: Maintains customer confidence and trust in services.

## Cybersecurity Domains

1. **Network Security**: Protects networking infrastructure from unauthorized access and attacks.
2. **Application Security**: Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
3. **Information Security**: Protects the integrity and privacy of data.
4. **Operational Security**: Includes processes for protecting data assets.
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Plans for recovery after a cybersecurity event.

## Common Cybersecurity Threats

- **Malware**: Software designed to harm or exploit systems (e.g., viruses, ransomware).
- **Phishing**: Attempts to acquire sensitive information by impersonating trustworthy sources.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting communication between two parties.
- **Denial-of-Service Attacks**: Overwhelming systems to make services unavailable.

## Basic Cybersecurity Practices

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Combine letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security.
- **Regularly Update Software**: Keeps systems protected against known vulnerabilities.
- **Back Up Data**: Ensures data can be restored in case of loss.
